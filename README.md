CSM Minimal WordPress Theme
====

A minimal WordPress theme with some basic customization options. I used Jared Erikson's [Less](https://github.com/alliswell/Less) as a framework and stripped out stuff that I didn't want. Then I added Font Awesome, an options page, lightweight social sharing (no js!) and a few other things to make it pretty!

The options page allows you to choose a base color (blue, pink or grey), add social profiles, header and favicon images and a footer copyright.

I would love feedback and feature requests! [Tweet me up!](https://twitter.com/ciaransm)

##Features:
- Responsive
- Minimal design to show off your content.
- An options page that allows easy setting of the header profile image, favicon, base color, copyright and social icon links.
- Social icons in the header (currently supports Twitter, Instagram, Behance, Facebook and Github).
- Three color options â€“ blue, pink and grey.
- Copyright option for footer
- [Lightweight social sharing without javascript](http://ciaranmahoney.me/lightweight-social-sharing-buttons-for-wordpress-without-javascript/6503). (Currently supports sharing to twitter, Facebook and Google Plus).
- [Font awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).
- 5 most recent posts listed after each post.
- Simple, CSS only dropdown menu that supports up 3 levels.
