CSM Minimal WordPress Theme
====

A minimal WordPress theme with some basic customization options. I used Jared Erikson's [Less](https://github.com/alliswell/Less) as a framework and stripped out stuff that I didn't want. Then I added Font Awesome, an options page, lightweight social sharing (no js!) and a few other things to make it pretty!

The options page allows you to choose a base color (blue, pink or grey), add social profiles, header and favicon images and a footer copyright. I also added the ability to insert js or html directly from the options page, without digging into theme files. I use this for inserting Google Tag Manager, MixPanel and Heap Analytics tracking javascript tags. It does not support php.

I would love feedback and feature requests! [Tweet me up!](https://twitter.com/ciaransm)
