CSM WordPress Theme
====

A simple minimal WordPress theme with some basic customization options. I used Jared Erikson's Less as a framework, fixed a few bugs and stripped out stuff that I thought was unnecessary. 

Then I added Font Awesome, an options page, lightweight social sharing (no js!), 5 recent posts and a few other things to make it pretty!

The options page allows you to choose a base color (blue, pink or grey), add social profiles, header and favicon images and a footer copyright.

Enjoy!
